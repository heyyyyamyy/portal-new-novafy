<div class="container">
    <p>1. Question: What is the difference between C and C++?</p>
    <p>   - Answer: C++ is an extension of C with additional features such as classes and objects, which support the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). C++ also introduces features like function overloading, templates, and exception handling, providing a more comprehensive programming paradigm.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>2. Question: Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its key principles.</p>
    <p>   - Answer: Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. The key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation hides the implementation details, inheritance allows code reuse, and polymorphism enables objects to take multiple forms.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>3. Question: What are smart pointers in C++ and how do they differ from raw pointers?</p>
    <p>   - Answer: Smart pointers are objects that act like pointers but provide automatic memory management. They differ from raw pointers by automatically handling memory deallocation, thus reducing the chances of memory leaks. `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` are examples of smart pointers in C++.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>4. Question: Explain the concept of virtual functions in C++.</p>
    <p>   - Answer: Virtual functions allow the base class to provide a specific implementation that can be overridden by derived classes. They enable runtime polymorphism, allowing the selection of the appropriate function to be called based on the type of object at runtime. To declare a function as virtual, use the `virtual` keyword in the base class.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>5. Question: What is the difference between pass by reference and pass by pointer in function arguments?</p>
    <p>   - Answer: Pass by reference involves passing the memory address of the actual parameter to the function, allowing direct manipulation of the original data. Pass by pointer is similar but explicitly uses pointers for passing and accessing data. Both methods avoid unnecessary copying of data, but pass by reference syntax is more transparent.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>6. Question: How does exception handling work in C++?</p>
    <p>   - Answer: C++ provides a mechanism for handling runtime errors called exception handling. It involves three keywords: `try`, `catch`, and `throw`. Code that might throw an exception is placed in the `try` block, and if an exception occurs, it is caught by the corresponding `catch` block. Exceptions are thrown using the `throw` keyword.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>7. Question: Explain the concept of templates in C++.</p>
    <p>   - Answer: Templates in C++ allow the creation of generic functions and classes, enabling code to work with different data types without redundancy. Function templates use the `template` keyword followed by the template parameter, while class templates provide a blueprint for creating generic classes.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>8. Question: What is the role of the "const" keyword in C++?</p>
    <p>   - Answer: The `const` keyword is used to declare constants and also to indicate that a variable, parameter, or function does not modify the data it operates on. It is a promise to the compiler that the value will not be changed, enhancing code readability and safety.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>9. Question: How do you manage memory in C++?</p>
    <p>   - Answer: Memory in C++ can be managed using dynamic memory allocation operators `new` and `delete` or `malloc` and `free`. It's crucial to deallocate memory to prevent memory leaks. Additionally, smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` help automate memory management.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>10. Question: Discuss the role of constructors and destructors in C++.</p>
    <p>   - Answer: Constructors are special member functions that initialize the object's state when it is created. Destructors, on the other hand, are responsible for cleaning up resources and releasing memory when the object goes out of scope. Constructors are invoked automatically during object creation, and destructors are called when the object is destroyed.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>11. Question: What is the Rule of Three in C++ and why is it important?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The Rule of Three states that if a class needs to define one of the following three special member functions (`destructor`, `copy constructor`, `copy assignment operator`), then it likely needs to define all three. This ensures proper resource management for dynamically allocated memory and prevents issues like shallow copying.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>12. Question: Explain the concept of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) in C++.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: RAII is a C++ programming paradigm where resource management (like memory, file handles, etc.) is tied to the lifetime of an object. Resources are acquired in the constructor and released in the destructor, ensuring proper cleanup and preventing resource leaks.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>13. Question: What are lambda expressions in C++ and how are they used?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: Lambda expressions are anonymous functions introduced in C++11. They provide a concise way to define small, inline functions. Lambda expressions are particularly useful in functional programming and when passing functions as arguments to algorithms or other functions.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>14. Question: What is the purpose of the `explicit` keyword in C++ and when would you use it?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `explicit` keyword is used in constructors to prevent implicit type conversion. When a constructor is marked as `explicit`, it ensures that the compiler doesn't perform automatic type conversions, making the code more explicit and less error-prone.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>15. Question: How does multiple inheritance work in C++ and what challenges might arise?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class. Challenges include the "diamond problem," where ambiguity can arise if two base classes have a common ancestor. C++ addresses this using virtual inheritance and the `virtual` keyword.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>16. Question: What are the differences between deep copy and shallow copy?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: Shallow copy duplicates only the memory addresses of the original object, while deep copy creates a new copy of the object and duplicates the contents. Shallow copies can lead to issues if the original and copied objects manage shared resources, while deep copies are safer but may be less efficient.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>17. Question: Explain the purpose and usage of the `typeid` operator in C++.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `typeid` operator is used to determine the data type of an expression or object at runtime. It returns a `std::type_info` object, which can be compared or used for type identification. It's often used in conjunction with dynamic casting.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>18. Question: What is the role of the `mutable` keyword in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `mutable` keyword is used to declare data members within a `const` member function that can be modified. It allows changing the value of a `mutable` member even if the function is declared as `const`, providing flexibility in specific scenarios.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>19. Question: How do you handle operator overloading in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: Operator overloading allows defining custom behavior for operators. It is achieved by creating special member functions with names like `operator+`, `operator-`, etc. Overloading operators can make user-defined types behave more like built-in types.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>20. Question: Explain the differences between stack and heap memory in C++.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: Stack memory is used for local variables and function call management, and it is automatically allocated and deallocated. Heap memory is dynamic memory managed by the programmer using `new` and `delete` or `malloc` and `free`. Understanding the distinctions is crucial for efficient memory management.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>21. Question: What is the difference between `nullptr` and `NULL` in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: In C++11 and later, `nullptr` is the preferred keyword for representing a null pointer, offering type safety and compatibility with templates. `NULL` is traditionally used in C and can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior when working with C++.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>22. Question: How does the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) enhance C++ programming?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The STL provides a collection of template classes and functions that implement several popular data structures and algorithms. It includes containers like vectors, lists, and maps, as well as algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating data. Using the STL can significantly enhance code reusability and maintainability.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>23. Question: Explain the purpose of the `const_iterator` in C++ and how it differs from a regular iterator.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: A `const_iterator` is an iterator that can be used to traverse elements in a container without allowing modification of the container's elements. It is essential when iterating over const containers or when you want to prevent modifications during traversal. Regular iterators, on the other hand, allow both reading and writing.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>24. Question: What is the role of the `volatile` keyword in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that a variable may be changed by multiple threads, preventing the compiler from optimizing away certain operations. It is often used when working with hardware registers or variables modified asynchronously outside the program's control.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>25. Question: How does the `std::move` function work, and when would you use it?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `std::move` is a utility function that converts an lvalue into an rvalue, allowing efficient transfer of resources, like ownership of memory, from one object to another. It is commonly used in move semantics and is particularly useful in optimizing the performance of certain operations, like moving objects in containers.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>26. Question: What is the purpose of the `override` keyword in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `override` keyword is used to explicitly indicate that a function in a derived class is intended to override a virtual function declared in the base class. It enhances code readability and helps catch errors if the intended overriding doesn't match the signature of the base class function.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>27. Question: How does the `std::thread` class facilitate multithreading in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `std::thread` class is part of the C++ Standard Library and is used to create and manage threads. Developers can use it to launch parallel execution of functions or member functions. It supports various operations, such as joining threads, detaching them, and transferring ownership.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>28. Question: What are move constructors and move assignment operators in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: Move constructors and move assignment operators allow the efficient transfer of resources (such as memory ownership) from one object to another, without unnecessary copying. They are crucial for optimizing performance in situations where copying is expensive, and moving is more efficient.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>29. Question: Explain the purpose of the `const` member function in C++ and its implications.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: A `const` member function is a member function declared with the `const` keyword, indicating that it does not modify the object's state. It allows the function to be called on const objects and promises not to modify any member variables. This is part of ensuring const correctness in C++.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>30. Question: How does the `std::unique` algorithm work in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `std::unique` algorithm is used to remove consecutive duplicate elements from a range in a container. It reorders the elements and returns an iterator pointing to the new logical end of the range. It is often used in conjunction with the `erase` method to remove duplicates from a container.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>31. Question: What is the role of the `constexpr` keyword in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `constexpr` keyword is used to indicate that a function or variable can be evaluated at compile time. It allows for the creation of constants and functions that can be used in contexts that require constant expressions, enhancing performance and flexibility.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>32. Question: How does C++ support operator overloading for user-defined types? Provide an example.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: Operator overloading in C++ allows user-defined types to use operators with custom behavior. For instance, you can overload the `+` operator for a custom class to perform specific operations. Example:</p>
    <p>    ```cpp</p>
    <p>    class MyVector {</p>
    <p>    public:</p>
    <p>        int x, y;</p>
    <p>        MyVector operator+(const MyVector& other) const {</p>
    <p>            MyVector result;</p>
    <p>            result.x = x + other.x;</p>
    <p>            result.y = y + other.y;</p>
    <p>            return result;</p>
    <p>        }</p>
    <p>    };</p>
    <p>    ```</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>33. Question: What is the purpose of the `std::forward` function in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `std::forward` is used in the context of perfect forwarding. It preserves the value category (lvalue or rvalue) of its argument, allowing you to forward arguments to other functions while maintaining the original value category.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>34. Question: Explain the purpose of the `decltype` keyword in C++ and provide an example of its usage.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `decltype` is used to deduce the type of an expression at compile time. It is useful in situations where the type is complex or not known in advance. Example:</p>
    <p>    ```cpp</p>
    <p>    int x = 5;</p>
    <p>    decltype(x) y = x; // y has the same type as x (int)</p>
    <p>    ```</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>35. Question: What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in the context of user-defined objects?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: A shallow copy duplicates only the memory addresses, while a deep copy creates a new copy of the entire object. For user-defined objects, a shallow copy can lead to issues if the object contains dynamically allocated memory, whereas a deep copy ensures a completely independent copy.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>36. Question: How does the `std::initializer_list` facilitate initializing objects in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `std::initializer_list` allows easy initialization of objects with a list of values. It is often used in constructor overloads to provide a convenient syntax for initializing objects. Example:</p>
    <p>    ```cpp</p>
    <p>    class MyClass {</p>
    <p>    public:</p>
    <p>        MyClass(std::initializer_list<int> values) {</p>
    <p>            // Initialize object with values</p>
    <p>        }</p>
    <p>    };</p>
    <p>    ```</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>37. Question: Explain the purpose of the `std::async` function in C++ and how it is used for asynchronous programming.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `std::async` is used to launch a function asynchronously, potentially on a separate thread. It returns a `std::future` that can be used to obtain the result of the asynchronous operation. It is part of the C++ Standard Library's support for multithreading.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>38. Question: What is the difference between function overloading and function overriding in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: Function overloading involves defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameters within the same scope. Function overriding occurs in the context of inheritance when a derived class provides a specific implementation for a virtual function declared in the base class.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>39. Question: How does the `std::tuple` class in C++ provide a heterogeneous container?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `std::tuple` is a standard template class that can hold elements of different types. Elements are accessed by their position within the tuple, and it provides a way to create functions that return multiple values without using out parameters.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>40. Question: What is the role of the `std::mutex` class in C++ and how does it contribute to managing concurrency?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `std::mutex` is part of the C++ Standard Library's support for multithreading. It is used to synchronize access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. Using `std::mutex` ensures that only one thread can access the protected resource at a time, preventing data races.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>41. Question: What is the purpose of the `override` specifier in C++11 and later, and how does it improve code safety?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `override` specifier is used to explicitly indicate that a member function in a derived class is intended to override a virtual function in the base class. It improves code safety by generating a compilation error if the function in the derived class doesn't match the signature of the base class function.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>42. Question: Explain the concept of SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) in the context of C++ templates.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: SFINAE is a principle in template metaprogramming where substitution failures in template parameter deduction are not treated as errors but result in the compiler trying other template instantiations. It is often used to enable or disable certain template specializations based on the properties of types.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>43. Question: What are the differences between the `std::vector` and `std::list` containers in C++?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `std::vector` is a dynamic array that provides fast random access but slow insertion and deletion at the middle. `std::list` is a doubly-linked list that allows efficient insertions and deletions but slower random access. The choice between them depends on the specific use case.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>44. Question: How does the C++ memory model contribute to concurrent programming, and what are memory barriers?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The C++ memory model defines the rules for how threads interact with memory. Memory barriers, such as `std::atomic_thread_fence`, are used to synchronize memory access between threads, ensuring that changes made by one thread are visible to others. They play a crucial role in preventing data races.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>45. Question: Explain the purpose of the `std::conditional` template and provide an example of its usage.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `std::conditional` is a template that conditionally selects one type or another based on a compile-time boolean condition. Example:</p>
    <p>    ```cpp</p>
    <p>    #include <type_traits></p>
    <p>    </p>
    <p>    template <bool UseInt></p>
    <p>    using MyType = typename std::conditional<UseInt, int, double>::type;</p>
    <p>    ```</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>46. Question: How does the C++ preprocessor differ from the compiler and what are some common use cases for preprocessor directives?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The preprocessor is a separate phase in the compilation process that handles tasks such as macro substitution, file inclusion, and conditional compilation. Common directives include `#define` for macros, `#include` for file inclusion, and `#ifdef` for conditional compilation.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>47. Question: Explain the purpose of the `std::reference_wrapper` class in C++ and provide an example of its usage.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `std::reference_wrapper` is a class template that provides a reference-like object with assignable semantics. It is often used when a reference needs to be stored in a container. Example:</p>
    <p>    ```cpp</p>
    <p>    #include <functional></p>
    <p>    </p>
    <p>    int main() {</p>
    <p>        int x = 42;</p>
    <p>        std::reference_wrapper<int> ref(x);</p>
    <p>        ref.get() = 10; // Changes the value of x</p>
    <p>        return 0;</p>
    <p>    }</p>
    <p>    ```</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>48. Question: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the `auto` keyword in C++ for variable type deduction?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: The `auto` keyword allows automatic type deduction during compilation, reducing the need to explicitly specify types. Advantages include increased code readability and adaptability to complex types. Disadvantages may include decreased code verbosity and potential readability issues for newcomers.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>49. Question: Explain the concept of CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) in C++ and provide an example of its application.</p>
    <p>    - Answer: CRTP is a template pattern where a derived class template inherits from a base class template with the derived class as a template argument. Example:</p>
    <p>    ```cpp</p>
    <p>    template <typename Derived></p>
    <p>    struct Base {</p>
    <p>        void interface() {</p>
    <p>            static_cast<Derived>(this)->implementation();</p>
    <p>        }</p>
    <p>        // ...</p>
    <p>    };</p>
    <p>    </p>
    <p>    struct Derived : Base<Derived> {</p>
    <p>        void implementation() {</p>
    <p>            // Implement functionality</p>
    <p>        }</p>
    <p>    };</p>
    <p>    ```</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>50. Question: How does the `constexpr if` feature introduced in C++17 improve template metaprogramming?</p>
    <p>    - Answer: `constexpr if` allows conditional execution of code at compile time based on a template parameter or constant expression. It simplifies and enhances the readability of template metaprogramming code by eliminating the need for SFINAE and enabling more straightforward conditional logic in templates.</p>
