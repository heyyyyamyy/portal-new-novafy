            <p>49.  Can you share your experience with conducting virtual interviews and how you ensure a fair and
                effective assessment in a remote setting?</p>
            <p> - Answer: I have adapted to virtual interviews by using video conferencing tools. To ensure fairness, I
                maintain standardized interview processes, provide clear instructions to candidates, and use technology
                to facilitate seamless interactions.</p>

            <p>50.  How do you handle situations where a candidate raises concerns about the company's work culture or
                reputation during the interview process?</p>
            <p> - Answer: I address these concerns transparently, providing insights into ongoing initiatives to improve work
                culture. Sharing success stories and testimonials from current employees can help alleviate any
                apprehensions.</p>
